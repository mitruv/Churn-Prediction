# Churn-Prediction
• Problem Definition: Developed a machine learning solution to predict customer churn and
identify key risk factors. Analyzed historical customer data to understand retention patterns.
• Data Processing & Analysis: Collected, cleaned, and preprocessed data using Pandas and
NumPy. Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. Explored feature
distributions and visualized churn patterns with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
• Model Development: Built and tested multiple models in Scikit-learn, including Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and GradientBoostingClassifier. Engineered new features to improve
model performance.
• Evaluation & Optimization: Assessed model quality using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,
ROC-AUC, and cross-validation. Tuned hyperparameters with GridSearchCV and
RandomizedSearchCV to optimize predictive performance.
• Results: Identified the most important factors contributing to churn and improved prediction
accuracy through feature engineering and model tuning. Provided data-driven recommendations
for reducing customer churn and increasing retention rates
